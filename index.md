<p>Hi, my name is Dan. I'm an NYC-based Software Engineer currently working at <a href="https://better.com" class="link highlight-link">Better Mortgage</a>.</p>
<p> My interests gravitate towards the intersection of technology, politics, and art.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out some of my <a href="https://www.thelog.farm" class="link highlight-link">writing</a> or <a href="./projects/index.html" class="link highlight-link">projects</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting in touch, below you can find some places I am present. I don't generally respond to cold emails, but if you're a founder I am generally happy to chat.</p>
